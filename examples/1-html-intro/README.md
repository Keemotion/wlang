# The WLang::Html dialect

This folder contains annotated examples of wlang templates. All examples use the WLang::Html dialect in particular, providing its basic documentation.

The example files contain a YAML front-matter which is needed to understand the explanations and to render the templates. The various example files are intended to be read *and* instantiated with the wlang command line tool:

    wlang --auto-spacing examples/1-basics.md.wlang

WLang 2.0.0.beta has some remaining issues about the way it handles spacing. For HTML rendering, this is not necessarily a big issue but it might slightly complicate your learning. Please apologize.
