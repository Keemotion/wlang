= WLang
WLang is a simple code generation/templating engine. The first post about it can
be found at http://www.revision-zero.org/wlang. It's main aim is to help you creating
web pages, sql queries, ruby code (that is, generating code in general) without 
having to worry too much about html entities encoding, sql back quoting, string
escaping and the like. WLang proposes a generic engine that you can extend to fit 
your needs. It also proposes standard instantiations of this engine for common
tasks such as creating SQL queries, instantiating web pages, etc.
