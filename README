= What is Revision-Zero ?

Revision-Zero is the Ruby library attached to Bernard Lambeau's blog (see http://www.revision-zero.org).
You'll find here implementations of the ideas commented on that site. The documentation 
here is self-contained, but having read the corresponding articles on the blog 
certainly helps understanding the objectives of each tool, as well as its internal
implementation (if you plan to extend them). You are also invited you to join the
{redmine of Revision-Zero}[http://redmine.chefbe.net/projects/show/revision-zero-public]
to report bugs, contribute to this project, ... Below is the list of development 
bricks built so far. Click on each of them to learn more about them.

== WLang
WLang is a simple code generation/templating engine. The first post about it can
be found at http://www.revision-zero.org/wlang. It's main aim is to help you creating
web pages, sql queries, ruby code (that is, generating code in general) without 
having to worry too much about html entities encoding, sql back quoting, string
escaping and the like. WLang proposes a generic engine that you can extend to fit 
your needs. It also proposes standard instantiations of this engine for common
tasks such as creating SQL queries, instantiating web pages, etc.
