==== r31 (blambeau)
* [wlang] 
* Adds Encoder class to void symetry problems between rules and encoders.
* Encoders renamed as EncoderSet, to be symetric with RuleSet.
* Documentation much improved.
* WLang specification automatically generated in Rakefile using ... wlang itself ;-)

==== r30 (blambeau)
* [revprop] Refactoring of ruby source files, to get simpler project structure to code.

==== r26 (blambeau)
* SQLMe and RMatch moved in sandbox as not being mature projects.
* Database example in wlang removed (because using sqlme which is not mature)

==== r22 (blambeau)
* Proof of concept: iterating database records. 

==== r20 (blambeau)
* Adds a context ruleset with a first implementation of .={...}

==== r19 (blambeau)
* Adds rdoc encoder with a wikirdoc sample.
* Implements xhtml/entities-encoding using CGI::escapeHTML
* Dialect modules/files refactored to be more syntax friendly.

==== r18 (blambeau)
* String extensions moved inside ruby_extensions.rb
* Documentation much improved.
* README and CHANGELOG adapted.

==== r17 (blambeau)
* CodeRay example slighlty modified.

==== r16 (blambeau)
* Imperative and Buffering rulesets started.
* CodeRay dialect created.
* Examples slightly extended.
* Template has the ability to know its source file and to resolve basic URIs.

==== r15 (blambeau)
* Provides lazy load of dialects (need to provide a require_gem and require_file instead of Ruby's require)
* Provides wlang commandline tool with basic options
* examples directory started.
* wlang/xhtml dialect started.

==== r13 (blambeau)
* Introduces a Template abstraction which encapsulates references to dialect and context.
* Template is also "block_symbols" aware and RuleSet.pattern takes that
* argument, allowing ${} as well as $() and $[] syntax (only one syntax allowed
* for a given template).

==== r12 (blambeau)
* Continues issue #49 inside wlang itself (removes revzero main folder)

==== r11 (blambeau)
* Resolves issue #49.
* Only sandbox is left on repository root, llambeau will be asked to switch it to a better location.

==== r10 (blambeau)
* Implements EncodingRuleSet from wlang_semantics document (see issue #46)
* Adds relative encoder usage in Parser#encode
* Provides Ruby dialect base implementation.
* Provides StandardDialects file/class.

==== r9 (blambeau)
* ParserState becomes Parser, which is stateful.
* Encoders vs. Rules difference implemented according to wlang semantics (see issue #46)
* Follows the wlang semantics of issue #46, not complete however.
* Provides a basic parser context for evaluations.
* Homework (issue) #32 is closed by this revision.

==== r8 (blambeau)
* Provides a basic test on the WLang::Parser. See Home Work 2009/01 on redmine.

==== r7 (blambeau)
* Documentation improved, GPL/Ruby licence added.

==== r6 (blambeau)
* Documentation and API improved.
* Horo template and Rakefile slightly modified.

==== r3 (blambeau)
* Ignores eclipse files and generated documentation.

==== r2 (blambeau)
* Initial revision of RevZero tools.
* This revision contains a first wlang implementation, not rigourously tested so
* far.

==== r1 (blambeau)
* Initial repository layout.
