  summary: |-
    WLang is a powerful code generation and templating engine
  description: |-
    WLang is a general-purpose *code generation*/*templating engine*. It's main aim is to help you generating
    web pages, sql queries, ruby code (that is, generating code in general) without having to worry too much 
    about html entities encoding, sql back quoting, string escaping and the like. WLang proposes a generic 
    engine that you can extend to fit your needs. It also proposes standard instantiations of this engine 
    for common tasks such as creating SQL queries, instantiating web pages, and so on.
