== Features 

- A <tt>**{wlang/ruby}{...}</tt> tag 'recursion' could be really useful to transform arrays
  into imbricate things: 
    **{["MyModule", "MySubModule"] as m, next}{
      module +{m}
        **+{next}
      end
    }

== Enhancements

- The inteligent output buffer could be much more intelligent. Handling spaces
  in general seems a hard ask, but is required.
